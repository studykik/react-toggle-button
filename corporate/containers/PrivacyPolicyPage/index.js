            <h3>Telephone Consumer Protection Act (47 U.S.C. § 227)</h3>
            <p>
              In compliance with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and the Cellular Telephone Industries Association (CTIA, an international industry trade group representing the interests of wireless telecommunications companies) we disclose on each opt-in page what users are to expect for SMS interaction and users agree to receive messages about current and future studies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users are given disclosure that text messages and data rates may apply.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users are given opt out instructions with each SMS message and may opt out at any time by texting STOP.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a user sends STOP we will prevent them from receiving any additional messages. Below is the exact message:
            </p>
            <p>
              “You have successfully been unsubscribed. You will not receive any more messages from this number.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Users receive an automated SMS message instantly after the user opts in via any web form.
            </p>
            <p>
              In compliance with TCPA, follow up SMS communication initiated by StudyKIK will only be sent between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. in the users’ time zone.
            </p>
            <p>
              All records are kept for a minimum of 4 years, which is the federal statute of limitations for bringing an action under the TCPA.
